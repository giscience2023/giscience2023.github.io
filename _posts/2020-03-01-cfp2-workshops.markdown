We are seeking proposals for full- or half-day Workshops and Tutorials on specialized topics or on emergent research fields that will be of interest to the GIScience community. These will take place prior to the main GIScience conference on 12 September 2023.

Workshops on a specific topic can be used for example to provide opportunities to present work in progress, with time allocated for discussion and participation, and tutorials can be used to address a single topic in depth or provide specific training in a new technique.

### Workshop/Tutorial proposals

To submit a proposal, please prepare the following:

1. A 1-page (max) PDF document that includes:
 - Title of the workshop
 - Workshop organizer(s)
 - Format of workshop (full or half day)
 - Previous related activities (if any)
 - Description of topic, rationale, and reason why this is relevant to GIScience attendees (including the scope and novelty of the workshop)
 - Any highlights (e.g., keynotes, panels, and other modes of discussion and participation)

2. An Appendix with the intended programme, brief timeline of planned activities, expected number of participants, any technical equipment etc required.

3. A draft Call for Participation to be used to advertise the workshop on the GIScience 2023 conference website.

### Evaluation Criteria

Proposal will be assessed using the following criteria: 
 - Is it an appropriate topic for GIScience?
 - Is the activity particularly timely or important?
 - Is it likely to attract sufficient participants?
 - Is it well-designed and likely to achieve the stated goal(s)?
 - Are the organizers appropriate for the proposed topic?
 - Have similar workshops been held in the recent past, and if so how does the proposal relate to those previous activities?

### Submission Instructions

All workshops proposals (as a single PDF document), as well as related questions, should be submitted via e-mail to the Workshops Chair [Prof Lex Comber](mailto:a.comber@leeds.ac.uk). The chair, along with at least two other members of the Organising Committee will review all proposals.
